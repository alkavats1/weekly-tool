## Features

- **Topics to talk:** A section where employees can write all ideas they want to talk. Then everyone can vote what the prefer (the most efective version is vote only 3 times but this is on pleople in the meeting).
- **Topic conversation time:** This section was thinking to keep the focus just in one topic. Meanwhile the topic is present, the timer will be shared to all members. A good idea is take 7 minutes for each topic. Again this is on people in the meetting.
- **Retrospective:** This section is for take notes about the meeting finish. It have three columns (more of, keep, less of) fot organice and visualize what pleople want to improve, keep and remove from weekly meetting).
- **Breakout:** This section is a free versionof breckout using a set of google meet room. each member will have a random link.
